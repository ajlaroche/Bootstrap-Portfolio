                <p class="AllAboutMe"> I was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. In addition to English, I speak French fluently. I have a Bachelor's
                    degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Florida and a Master's in Engineering Management
                    from the George Washington University. I have spent the last 18 years working in the refining industry
                    in a wide variety of roles ranging from process engineering to project development and refinery economics.
                </p>
                <p class="AllAboutMe">In addition to my work as an engineer, I have a passion for finance and economics. As a result, I spend a
                    lot of my spare time reading and analyzing the financial news of the day. I take pleasure in deciphering
                    insights from the wealth of data available to us from news outlets and government agencies with the ultimately
                    goal of converting those insight to personal investment strategies and general worldly advice. </p>
                <p class="AllAboutMe">I am Full Stack Web Developer who is available to perform freelance work for content producers who want to
                    share their work, art, skills, wisdom, knowledge with the world. I also consult and enhance existing
                    3rd party developed websites to improve user experience, add interactivity, add data collection and analysis.
